# Code-Reading-Guide
**The purpose writing the code Reading Guide is to help other developers understand and analyze the Python Project more easily.
Hopefully, it will help you save time, reduce misunderstandings, and facilitate better collaboration.**

# Before Everything
**1. for Reading**
   
   `model_structure.png` in the corresponding project directory is a skeleton diagram of the model, you can view the file to further familiarize yourself with the project. Don't be completely unaware of our work.

**2. for Experimentation and Development**
   
   Please check the corresponding `requirements.txt` and ensure that the necessary third-party Python libraries are installed. And refer to `README.md` file for the instructions on how to run the project. Basically, the names of the methods in the code are consistent with the names of the algorithms used. When developing, please refer to relevant materials to understand the principles of the algorithms.

# Understanding the Source Code

**1. code_interpretation**

In this file, the code is interpreted, including the structure of the code, the role of each package, and the explanation of some functions.

**2. FAQ**

This file records common problems, including problems encountered during code debugging and questions that readers may have. If you have new questions, please record them at the _beginning_ of this file. If you have other questions that you think need to be reminded, please add them at the _end_ of the document.

# Update the Source Code

**1. project_update_log**

If you find issues with the project, or add new functions, please document it in this file. If necessary, update the code structure and related explanations in [project_code_interpretation.md](project_code_interpretation.md).

# Result
**result_log**

This document includes any operational results that need to be recorded or shared.
